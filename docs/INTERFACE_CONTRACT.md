# HID Interface Contract

## Current browser and notification boundary

Production browsers call relative `/api/v1/*` URLs on their own approved app
hostname. The app-specific Cloudflare Worker proxies only that versioned
namespace to the fixed AWS origin and never accepts an upstream from browser
input. Cookie sessions are host-only; browser token storage is prohibited.

Authentication OTP commands are purpose-bound and use three stages: start
returns a generic challenge, verify accepts exactly six digits and returns an
opaque one-time completion credential, and complete consumes that credential.
Identity calls Notification API directly over workload authentication; these
credentials never use the ordinary-notification event path. Ordinary domain
events remain minimum-necessary versioned envelopes delivered through outbox,
Event Dispatcher, EventBridge/SQS, Notification Worker, and Novu.

## 1. Purpose

This document defines communication rules between HID clients and services.

Service implementations may evolve internally, but public contracts must remain explicit and versioned.

## 2. API Version

Current API version:

```text
/api/v1
```

Breaking future interfaces should use a new API version.

Do not silently break v1 clients.

## 3. API Entry

External clients use the approved API-only Gateway/BFF through the fixed
Cloudflare-to-AWS origin path.

Clients include:

* Next.js web
* React/Vite applications
* future mobile applications
* approved external integrations

## 4. General Rules

APIs must:

* validate requests
* authenticate protected requests
* authorize protected operations
* enforce facility context
* produce correlation IDs
* audit sensitive operations
* use consistent errors
* avoid unnecessary sensitive data
* remain mobile-friendly
* support idempotency for applicable writes

## 5. Recommended Headers

Use as applicable:

```text
Authorization
Content-Type
Idempotency-Key
If-Match
X-Correlation-ID
X-CSRF-Token
X-Facility-ID
X-Purpose-Of-Use
```

Do not expose secrets or raw sensitive identifiers through headers unnecessarily.

## 6. Problem Details

Use a consistent machine-readable error structure.

Conceptual fields:

```json
{
  "type": "problem-uri",
  "title": "Readable title",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Safe detail",
  "instance": "request-instance",
  "correlationId": "uuid",
  "code": "MACHINE_CODE"
}
```

Do not leak:

* secrets
* database details
* stack traces
* NIN
* access tokens
* protected clinical information

## 7. Health Endpoints

Every service should provide:

```text
GET /api/v1/health/live
GET /api/v1/health/ready
```

`live` confirms process health.

`ready` confirms required dependencies are ready.

### Extracted Identity boundary

The gateway preserves public `/api/v1/auth/*`, `/api/v1/identity/*`, and
`/api/v1/audit/*` URLs while routing them to `services/identity-api` on port
3001. EHR no longer hosts those routes.

Internal consumers use `packages/api-client` rather than direct database access
or scattered fetch calls. Every sensitive internal call carries two independent
forms of evidence:

```text
propagated user Authorization/cookie + facility/purpose/correlation
approved service workload identity + exact caller name
```

Identity validates both. Cookie mutation validation also propagates the exact
Origin and CSRF header/cookie evidence. Production workload evidence is an
issuer/JWKS-validated, audience-bound, unexpired JWT with an exact configured
caller subject; local per-caller secrets are development-only.

Internal actor/session validation uses `GET /api/v1/auth/service-session`, or
`POST` for cookie mutation revalidation. Patient decisions use
`POST /api/v1/identity/service/authorization/check`. These return API DTOs,
never database rows. Problem Details status/code, correlation, bounded timeout,
and safe JSON request bodies are preserved by the typed client.

## 8. Identity Resolution

HID lookup uses the existing versioned Identity resolution interface. Sensitive
NIN resolution uses the active body-based contract:

```text
POST /api/v1/identity/nin/resolve
```

Supported resolution inputs:

* HID
* NIN

For sensitive NIN lookup, prefer a body-based protected request when query-string exposure would create logging or browser-history risk.

### HID Resolution

Input:

* HID

Return only authorized patient identity information required by the caller.

### NIN Resolution

Flow:

1. validate format
2. verify through NIN provider abstraction when required
3. use a keyed lookup HMAC to search verified bindings
4. search deterministic demographic candidates when no binding exists
5. create or replay an idempotent registration case
6. audit lookup and case creation atomically
7. return only the case state and an authorized canonical patient reference when already resolved

Do not unnecessarily return raw NIN.
Do not persist an unkeyed digest of raw NIN in idempotency records.

### Registration Cases

```text
GET  /api/v1/identity/registration-cases/:caseId
POST /api/v1/identity/registration-cases/:caseId/approve-new
POST /api/v1/identity/registration-cases/:caseId/link-existing
```

`resolve`, `approve-new`, and `link-existing` require `Idempotency-Key`.
Review commands require `expectedVersion` and fail with a version conflict when
the case changed. Replaying the same key and canonical request returns the
existing terminal result; reusing a key with a different request returns a
conflict.

Case states currently include:

```text
pending_new_identity_approval
review_required
resolved_existing_identity
linked_existing
approved_new_identity
rejected
cancelled
```

`resolved_existing_identity` means the verified NIN was already bound and no
identity mutation occurred. `linked_existing` requires explicit review of a
stored candidate. `approved_new_identity` is the only transition that may issue
a new canonical UUID and HID.

### Outreach registration boundary

```text
GET  /api/v1/outreach/registration-cases
GET  /api/v1/outreach/registration-cases/:caseId
POST /api/v1/outreach/registration-cases
POST /api/v1/outreach/registration-cases/:caseId/link-existing
```

All requests require authenticated Identity user context, an authorized exact
`X-Facility-ID`, `X-Purpose-Of-Use: direct-care`, and a correlation ID. Cookie
requests also require the same-origin `Origin` and CSRF token. Writes require a
stable `Idempotency-Key`. Creation accepts a UUID-v4 local command ID and only a
`tmp_<uuid-v4>` temporary patient reference; it always returns
`identity_resolution_pending` initially.

`link-existing` requires a canonical Identity patient UUID, a reason, and the
exact expected Outreach row version. Outreach calls the Identity authorization
boundary with separate `outreach-api` workload evidence before opening the
mutation transaction. Stale versions return 412; a reused idempotency key with
different content returns 409; Identity/dependency failure never returns
success. There is no Outreach create-patient, HID, NIN, campaign, encounter,
screening, document, OCR, or EHR-ingestion endpoint in this slice.

## 9. Patient Identifier Contract

Conceptual identifier:

```text
id
patient_id
type
protected value
verified
registration_case_id for NIN
created_at
```

Rules:

* HID remains canonical application identifier.
* NIN is secondary.
* verified NIN is unique.
* NIN is never patient primary key.

## 10. Authorization Contract

Services requiring access to patient data must obtain approved authorization context.

Authorization should include:

* actor
* active facility
* patient
* purpose
* permission
* consent or break-glass evidence where required
* expiration when applicable

Do not authorize based only on UI-selected roles.

## 11. EHR

EHR endpoints operate on canonical Identity patient IDs.

Representative resources:

```text
/api/v1/ehr/patients/:patientId/encounters
/api/v1/ehr/patients/:patientId/encounters/:encounterId/clinical-notes
/api/v1/ehr/patients/:patientId/encounters/:encounterId/vitals
/api/v1/ehr/patients/:patientId/encounters/:encounterId/diagnoses
/api/v1/ehr/patients/:patientId/encounters/:encounterId/prescriptions
/api/v1/ehr/patients/:patientId/encounters/:encounterId/prescriptions/:prescriptionId/pharmacy-work-item
```

All writes require:

* verified actor
* facility context
* authorization
* validation
* audit
* appropriate concurrency protection

## 12. Lab

EHR communicates with Lab through Lab APIs.

Representative operations:

```text
POST /api/v1/lab/requests
GET  /api/v1/lab/requests/:requestId
PATCH /api/v1/lab/requests/:requestId
POST /api/v1/lab/imports
GET  /api/v1/lab/imports/:importId
```

`POST /api/v1/lab/imports` is an idempotent Lab-owned command for imported
external evidence. It requires the canonical Identity patient UUID, importing
facility context, an authorized source document, one or more bounded imported
observations, `Idempotency-Key`, and `X-Purpose-Of-Use: direct-care`. It never
represents native HID accessioning, specimen handling, execution, QC, or Lab
verification. OCR LAB publication invokes the same Lab service contract with
the exact document, job, extraction, validation/version, publication, patient,
facility, reviewer, and publishing actor references.

Exact contract should be documented through OpenAPI.

Lab results may notify consuming services through events.

## 13. Pharmacy

EHR communicates with Pharmacy through Pharmacy APIs.

Implemented operations:

```text
POST /api/v1/pharmacy/work-items/accept-ehr-prescription  # internal EHR caller
GET  /api/v1/pharmacy/work-items
GET  /api/v1/pharmacy/work-items/:workItemId
POST /api/v1/pharmacy/work-items/:workItemId/dispensings
GET  /api/v1/pharmacy/dispensings/:dispensingId
POST /api/v1/pharmacy/dispensings/:dispensingId/reversals
POST /api/v1/pharmacy/imports/from-ocr                  # internal OCR caller
GET  /api/v1/pharmacy/imports/:importId
```

EHR's public handoff command requires the prescription ID, current expected row
version, reason, and `Idempotency-Key`. EHR locks and verifies the current
`active` prescription before sending its exact canonical patient, same-facility
source ID/version, encounter, medication/dose/route/frequency/instructions,
prescriber, and timestamp snapshot. Pharmacy reauthorizes the actor and
patient, enforces same-facility processing, and returns an `accepted` work item.
That result never means `dispensed`.

Dispensing is a separate Pharmacy command requiring an accepted work item,
expected work-item version, positive quantity/unit, reason, pharmacist
permission, non-break-glass write authorization, and idempotency. This slice
allows one full dispensing per work item; partial fills and refills are not
modeled. Reversal requires the exact dispensing version and appends a preserved
relationship rather than updating or deleting the original event.

The OCR import command accepts only the exact reviewed document/job/extraction/
validation/version/publication provenance and bounded medication text. Its
response is always `IMPORTED_MEDICATION_EVIDENCE` with activity status
`unknown`; no request can supply `active`, `dispensed`, stock, or administration
state. No direct EHR- or OCR-to-Pharmacy database access exists.

## 14. OCR

The gateway owns `/api/v1/ocr/*` and routes it to the independently runnable
OCR API on port 3005. Port 3002 is EHR-only and must not expose these routes.
The EHR browser UI consumes the shared typed OCR contracts/client without
changing public URLs.

Current durable job endpoints:

```text
POST /api/v1/ocr/jobs
GET  /api/v1/ocr/jobs?documentId=:documentId
GET  /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId
POST /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/retry
GET  /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/extractions
POST /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/validation
POST /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/validations
GET  /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/validations
POST /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/patient-confirmation
POST /api/v1/ocr/validations/:validationId/publications
GET  /api/v1/ocr/validations/:validationId/publications
```

The document-scoped job lookup returns the latest authorized job as
`{ job: OcrJob | null }`. The EHR review client also uses
`GET /api/v1/ehr/documents?patientId=:patientId&encounterId=:encounterId` to
list safe document metadata in the active patient and encounter boundary.
Both reads re-authorize canonical patient access on the server; document
storage keys and provider credentials are never returned. Source preview uses
the existing authorized short-lived document download command.

Job creation accepts:

* an authorized registered document identifier
* a provider-neutral provider selector
* an optional already-known canonical Identity patient UUID
* `Idempotency-Key`

The server resolves the private immutable object reference and requires an
exact current clean-scan binding. A repeated key with the same canonical
request returns the existing job; a different request conflicts. Reads,
retries, and validation reauthorize against the source document's canonical
patient and exact actor facility.

OCR resolves that evidence through the internal typed EHR contract rather than
EHR SQL:

```text
GET  /api/v1/ehr/internal/ocr/documents/:documentId/source
POST /api/v1/ehr/internal/ocr/patients/:patientId/clinical-notes
```

These routes require propagated human authentication plus an independent exact
`ocr-api` workload identity. The source read returns only the document,
patient, facility, object-version, SHA-256, status, and scan status required by
OCR. The clinical-note command requires `ocr-publication:<publicationId>`
idempotency and preserves the existing immutable provenance contract. They are
not browser endpoints.

Return only governed job/extraction fields including:

```text
job identifier
extracted text
structured fields
confidence scores
processing status
```

OCR output is provisional.

No clinical record may be created solely from this response.

## 15. OCR Validation

Provide an explicit validation workflow.

Validation operation:

```text
POST /api/v1/ocr/jobs/:jobId/validation
```

Exact design may evolve.

Required invariant:

Human confirmation precedes clinical persistence.

Validation appends a corrected candidate referencing the immutable source
extraction. It does not publish to EHR, Lab, Pharmacy, or Identity.

Validation records an explicit `validated` or `rejected` disposition, confirmed
target domain, HID-owned candidate type, accepted/rejected fields, corrections,
reviewer, reason, and provenance. It requires `Idempotency-Key` and an expected
OCR job version. The singular validation route remains a compatible alias.

Patient confirmation is a separate idempotent command bound to the canonical
Identity patient already governing the source document. The server rechecks
write authorization and rejects break-glass, facility mismatch, wrong-patient,
and stale job versions.

Publication requires `Idempotency-Key`, `direct-care`, an explicit validation
ID/version, and the latest confirmation ID. Current operations are EHR
`create_imported_clinical_note`, Lab `create_imported_lab_evidence`, Pharmacy
`create_imported_medication_evidence`, and `retain_validated_document` for
`DOCUMENT_ONLY`. EHR creates a draft imported
note with immutable source provenance. Lab creates explicitly imported external
evidence through its owning command and exact OCR provenance. Pharmacy creates
historical medication evidence through its owning command and exact provenance;
it cannot create Pharmacy work or dispensing.

The OCR API uses typed shared clients for Identity, EHR, Lab, and Pharmacy.
User credentials, facility, purpose, correlation, CSRF/origin evidence where
applicable, and idempotency are propagated separately from workload identity.
Calls are bounded; idempotent publication calls retry only transient transport
or 502/503/504 failures. OCR never reports `published` until the owning service
returns its durable resource reference.

## 16. Storage

Uploads should use controlled storage flows.

Never return permanent public healthcare document URLs.

Use:

* authorized upload intent
* signed upload
* completion confirmation
* authorized download
* short-lived signed access where appropriate

## 17. Event Contracts

Events must contain:

* event ID
* event type
* event version
* occurred timestamp
* correlation ID
* producer
* domain identifiers required by consumer
* safe metadata

Potential events:

```text
OCRCompleted
EncounterCreated
LabResultAvailable
PrescriptionIssued
ConsentUpdated
OutreachCompleted
```

Consumers must be idempotent.

Events must not expose unnecessary sensitive information.

The implemented external contract is `ng.hid.event-envelope` schema version 1
with stable `id`, registered `type` and `version`, RFC-3339 `occurredAt`,
`producer`, aggregate type/ID/version, correlation and optional causation IDs,
nullable facility/patient context IDs, and a producer-registered PHI-minimal
payload. The complete JSON shape and active type inventory are authoritative in
`EVENT_DELIVERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

EventBridge acceptance is at-least-once transport delivery, not consumer
completion. A publish/mark crash can redeliver the same ID. Consumers must
deduplicate by their own name plus stable event ID and atomically commit their
business effect with the durable inbox processed marker. Unsupported event
versions are not guessed or coerced; they become terminal delivery evidence.

### Native Lab accession and specimen API

`GET /api/v1/lab/work-items`, `POST /api/v1/lab/work-items/{id}/accession`,
`GET /api/v1/lab/accessions/{id}`, and specimen `collect`, `receive`, and
`reject` subcommands form the minimum native operations contract. Mutations
require active facility context, direct-care purpose, Lab permission,
canonical-patient non-break-glass authorization, idempotency, and expected
versions. Receipt records custody only; it creates no execution, QC, or result.

## 18. API Documentation

Public and internal service APIs should maintain OpenAPI documentation.

Contract changes must update:

* OpenAPI
* this file
* ADRs where architecture changes

### Lab execution and governed-result API

Lab exposes specimen execution create/list, execution read/complete, result
entry, result correction, exact-version verification, separate release, and
released-history reads under `/api/v1/lab`. Execution requires the expected
received specimen version and exact accepted requested-test reference. Entry
and correction append `manual`, initially `unverified` revisions; entry never
means verified or released. Verification and release are distinct idempotent
commands with separate permissions, reasons, and expected result versions.
Release requires prior verification of the exact version. A post-release
correction appends a new unverified version and preserves released history;
ordinary released-result readers receive 404 until at least one release exists.

### Extracted Lab transport

Public Lab routes remain `/api/v1/lab/*` through the gateway. Internal EHR order acceptance uses `POST /api/v1/lab/work-items/accept-ehr-order`; governed OCR publication uses `POST /api/v1/lab/imports/from-ocr`. Both preserve bearer or Identity session-cookie user evidence, facility, purpose, correlation ID, and idempotency key and additionally require authenticated internal-caller identity. Cookie mutations also preserve the Cookie header, Origin, and CSRF header so Identity can revalidate the unsafe request through `POST /api/v1/auth/service-session`. User and workload credentials remain separate. Local development uses one process-generated ephemeral credential. Production requires a rotating asymmetric JWT from an injected token file, exact issuer/JWKS/audience validation, and distinct configured EHR/OCR subjects; local-secret mode is rejected.

### Extracted Pharmacy transport

Public Pharmacy reads and pharmacist commands remain
`/api/v1/pharmacy/*` through the gateway. EHR prescription acceptance and OCR
medication import use internal-only routes with exact caller metadata. The
shared Pharmacy client propagates bearer or Identity session-cookie user
evidence, facility, purpose, correlation ID and idempotency key. Cookie
mutations preserve Cookie, Origin, and CSRF for Identity revalidation through
the POST service-session route. The client applies a 10-second timeout and at
most one retry for an idempotent network/502/503/504 failure, parses Problem
Details, and obtains a fresh workload credential for each attempt. A separate
workload header is mandatory. Production rejects shared-secret mode and
requires rotating Pharmacy-audience JWT files plus exact EHR/OCR subject
verification. The Lab client follows the same bounded retry and per-attempt
credential-refresh policy.

## 19. Platform Administration API

The gateway sends `/api/v1/admin/*` to Identity. All routes require the normal
Identity user credential and an explicit backend `platform.*` capability.
Platform roles are not clinical roles and cannot satisfy EHR, Lab, Pharmacy,
OCR, or Outreach permissions.

Read endpoints:

```text
GET /api/v1/admin/session
GET /api/v1/admin/overview
GET /api/v1/admin/facilities?page=&pageSize=&status=&query=
GET /api/v1/admin/facilities/:facilityId
GET /api/v1/admin/principals?query=&page=&pageSize=&status=
GET /api/v1/admin/identity/reviews?page=&pageSize=&status=
GET /api/v1/admin/audit/events?limit=&beforeSequenceId=&actor=&facilityId=&action=&correlationId=&outcome=&from=&to=
GET /api/v1/admin/operations/services
GET /api/v1/admin/operations/events
```

Principal search requires at least two characters. Facility, principal, and
review page sizes are bounded to 100; audit pages are bounded to 200 and use a
descending sequence cursor. Raw NIN, password material, tokens, event payloads,
patient audit identifiers, and free-form audit details are absent.

Command endpoints:

```text
POST /api/v1/admin/facilities/:facilityId/status
POST /api/v1/admin/principals/:accountId/status
POST /api/v1/admin/principals/:accountId/platform-roles
POST /api/v1/admin/principals/:accountId/sessions/revoke
```

Every command requires `Idempotency-Key` and a reason of 8–500 characters.
Versioned commands also require `If-Match: "<positive-version>"`. Exact
replays return `replayed: true`; a reused key with a different digest returns
409, stale versions return 409, missing `If-Match` returns 428, and last-admin
protection returns 409. Cookie mutations keep the existing exact Origin and
CSRF contract. Problem Details and correlation IDs remain the only error
surface.

Operations aggregation forwards `X-Correlation-ID`, uses a 250–5000 ms
configured bound (1500 ms default), reports each dependency independently,
and whitelists terminal failure fields. No arbitrary retry command exists.

## 20. Browser gateway and application contract

The one-origin gateway serves Web at `/` and proxies EHR, Lab, Pharmacy, OCR,
Outreach, and Admin at `/ehr/`, `/lab/`, `/pharmacy/`, `/ocr/`, `/outreach/`,
and `/admin/`. These UI prefixes are distinct from API ownership:
`/api/v1/pharmacy/*` remains Pharmacy API-owned and `/api/v1/ocr/*` remains OCR
API-owned. Browser applications call only gateway API paths with Identity
cookies/CSRF, exact facility and purpose context, correlation, and idempotency
where the owning command requires it. No browser calls an internal host/port.

Pharmacy reads only existing work items/evidence and sends acceptance,
dispensing, and reversal commands through the typed Pharmacy client. A UI state
becomes `dispensed` or `reversed` only from a successful authoritative response;
the exact expected server version is preserved. OCR Operations uses the typed
OCR client for job/document reads, job create/retry, and lifecycle state. It
does not receive a generic clinical write, provider-success, or patient-create
interface. Clinical review/publication authority remains governed in context.

All workers are path-scoped and exclude `/api/`. Outreach offline storage is
encrypted IndexedDB with stable command idempotency and reconnect
reauthorization. Other apps are offline-aware but have no persisted mutation
outbox in this checkpoint. No frontend may expose a database connection,
workload credential, broad mutation endpoint, raw PHI telemetry, or untrusted
HTML execution surface.

Frontend telemetry accepts only enumerated product event names and primitive
allowlisted properties. Safe correlation IDs may accompany sanitized technical
errors; request/response bodies, URLs, headers, identity/clinical content, and
OCR extraction text are never part of the browser telemetry contract.
